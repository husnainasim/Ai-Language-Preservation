    question: "What types of policies can I simulate?",
    answer: "You can simulate a wide range of policies including tax reforms, environmental regulations, social welfare programs, and economic stimulus packages. The platform supports both single-policy analysis and complex multi-policy scenarios.",
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate are the AI forecasts?",
    answer: "Our AI forecasting system, powered by Gemini API, achieves an average accuracy of 95% in predicting policy impacts. The system continuously learns from new data and real-world outcomes to improve its predictions.",
  },
  {
    question: "What data sources does the platform use?",
    answer: "We integrate data from multiple reliable sources including government databases, economic indicators, environmental monitoring systems, and public sentiment analysis. All data is securely stored using NeonDB and processed through our AI models.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I export my simulation results?",
    answer: "Yes, you can export comprehensive PDF reports containing all simulation data, visualizations, and AI-generated insights. These reports are perfect for presentations, policy briefs, or academic research.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data secure?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We use Clerk with Passkeys for secure authentication and implement industry-standard encryption for all data. Your simulations and results are protected with enterprise-grade security measures.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a simulation take?",
    answer: "Most simulations complete within minutes, depending on the complexity of the scenario. Our platform uses Inngest for orchestrating long-running simulations, ensuring reliable and efficient processing.",
